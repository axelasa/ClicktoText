This is an android app developed in #KOtlin whose main aim is allow for texting a whatsapp number without necessarily saving the number.
The app is my first development in Kotlin for android and intoduces several basic concepts to beginners in Kotlin
i have used the Country code picker Library by hbb to select country codes and format phone numbers correctly: https://github.com/hbb20/CountryCodePickerProject
also used a gradle plugin kotlin extensions (https://medium.com/coding-blocks/goodbye-findviewbyid-say-hello-to-synthetic-binding-in-kotlin-d3727bd8438e) the extension allows for synthetic binding thereby removing the need to call "findviewbyid"
